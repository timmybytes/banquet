## ü•ò About

Main Course is an opinionated boilerplate for creating [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects. There are _many_ great starter templates out there for settings up a web development project, but there always seems to be a few things I want that are missing from most of them. Main Course aims to solve this by front-loading more tools and configurations as defaults with less tinkering required.

It's configured with the following out of the box:

- [Next.js](https//nextjs.org) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Support for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) with SCSS/SASS
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) + [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Plop.js](https://github.com/plopjs/plop) code generator

### üç± Structure

Main Course follows a common React project style:

```bash
public/
  images/
  favicon
src/
  assets/
  components/
    SomeComponent/
      SomeComponent.tsx
      SomeComponent.test.tsx
      SomeComponent.module.scss
      index.ts
  pages/
    _app.tsx
    index.tsx
  styles/
    _theme.scss
  utils/
  ...
```

This differs a little from the initial Next.js structure, which doesn't use a `src` directory by default, but is still [fully compatible with all of Next's features](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory).

Components are also kept in their own directories with related files, and when creating new components and pages with [`yarn bake`](./docs/plop.md), the same structure is followed by default.

Main Course uses a basic custom `Layout` component to wrap all pages that includes a `Header/Nav` and `Footer` component. When creating new pages, you can forgo having to manually add a header/footer, and simply add your desired content components. They'll be automatically wrapped with the given layout.

### üßÅ Plop.js: Bake new components, pages, etc.

Main Course comes with a `bake` command to invoke a CLI code generator called [Plop](https://plopjs.com). You can use it to add new components, tests, pages, etc., based on the included [`.hbs`](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) templates‚Äîor create ones yourself!

The included templates can generate:

- A new `tsx` component with accompanying `.test`, `.scss`, and `index.ts` files inside their own directory in `src/components`
- _Only_ a `.tsx` component inside its own directory in `src/components`
- A new page inside `src/pages`

To use it, run `yarn bake` from the terminal, and choose from the options available, or [read more about using Plop in Main Course](docs/plop.md).

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Chakra UI

Main Course also includes [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as a dependency. Main Course uses Chakra because of its flexibility, ease of use, and accessibility. You can use it as a basis for a project theme, customize the Chakra components, or delete it altogether if it isn't useful to you.

## üçΩ Getting Started

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timmybytes/main-course.git
cd main-course
yarn
```

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Customizing

Update main site data from `src/components/Meta/SiteData` in the `SITE_DATA` object to your own branding/copy:

```tsx
export const SITE_DATA = {
  title: 'Main Course',
  description: 'A gourmet Next.js boilerplate',
  author: 'Timothy Merritt',
  authorHandle: '@timmybytes', // For Twitter link cards
  authorHomepage: 'https://timmybytes.com',
  color: '#e9c46a',
  // etc.
}
```

This data will populate throughout the site, and can be easily imported into new components/pages with `import {SITE_DATA} from ‚Äò@components/Meta`.
